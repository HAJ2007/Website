                <p><strong>Little bit about me:</strong></p>
                
                <p class = "x">
                    I aspire to become a software developer. You might wonder why, well, there’s more than one answer. 
                    My number one reason is that software development, or technology itself, feels like a reflection of who I am.
                    I’ve always loved to draw and create. I find a unique satisfaction in building something aesthetically pleasing that requires effort and patience, 
                    and I’ve always enjoyed that. But contrarily, I have always loved  logic, and have always found it intriguing to solve problems,
                    figure things out, put pieces together to form something new,
                    or take something apart to understand its mysterious inner workings.
                    To me, technology is a culmination of all these interests. While creativity isn’t always obvious in technical roles,
                    I strongly believe that solving real-world problems to some extent requires it.
                    You have to be innovative, think outside the box, and crafty about your solutions that often extend beyond just writing code.
                    The sense of purpose you feel when things work as they should is oddly peaceful.</p>
                <br>
                <p class = "x">And that’s why I’m passionate about pursuing software development.</p>
                <br>
                <p class = "x">I also have other hobbies that reflect my interests and individuality. I enjoy drawing and painting. Every time I complete a piece, 
                I feel a sense of accomplishment that allows me to channel my creativity. My preferred art style is realism, but I have experimented with other styles. 
                I work best with pencils, but also enjoy using acrylics. This hobby has taught me patience and attention to detail, 
                as well as adaptability, especially when working with watercolours. I enjoy creating, whether it’s a piece of code or an artwork, 
                and I find it thrilling to learn, experiment, grow, and adapt. This reflects my chaotic self that is somehow contained within an orderly self.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class = "x">I also enjoy reading mostly fictional, non-academic works. 
                Since English is not my first language, I see reading as a way to expand my vocabulary and strengthen my communication.
                I particularly enjoy books aimed at children and teenagers. They often contain descriptions that uniquely reflect how young people perceive the world, 
                rather than how adults assume they do. When I read them now as a young adult, I find a surprising level of depth, a reminder of how our understanding evolves as we grow, shifting from the explicit to recognising deeper, implicit meanings.
                I also read scientific articles and academic books, which help me understand more about the subjects I am studying 
                and the ways the world itself is changing.

                        <p class="x">I have learned Python as part of my computer science A-level.
                        I have experience working with lists, dictionaries and subprograms. 
                        I implemented string manipulation in some of my personal projects.
                        My familiarity with the random library and dateTime helped me build interesting projects.
                        I have also tried to experiment with pandas and the transformers library to enhance my code.

                        <p class="x"> HTML is what introduced me to coding. Initially, I used embedded styling in my HTML files. 
                        But during A-levels, I was introduced to CSS through which I was able to organise my code, making it efficient for layout and design. 
                        I have also experimented with JavaScript in my code, though I am not an expert in it and barely a beginner. But I am quite familiar with HTML and have created simple websites with minimal styling.

                       <p class="x">
                        As part of my EPQ, I have researched a chosen topic through which I acquired transferable skills.
                        I improved organisation due to the requirement of storing and analysing various documents to identify information.
                        I also improved my time management and practised efficient time-to-task division. I have also improved my vocabulary and writing skills, both of which will improve my communication

                       <p class="x">Due to my Maths A-level, I have managed to improve my problem-solving skills. In addition to this, I also enjoy playing chess, which helps with my ability to solve problems and think flexibly </p>

                    <li>

                        <p class="x">I understand 3 languages: Malayalam, English and Hindi. I am really confident with Malayalam (my native language) and English. My proficiency in Hindi is limited, and my grammar in this language is not great. However, I can read and write this language decently and speak it with a limited vocabulary
